# Pyth.io Console
Python console for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

TO USE:
Download the source code if you have Python
Run main.py

TO INSTALL:
Use pycompile to compile the Python program, add it to your Start menu i guess,
also on linux you could theoretically just add python3 main.py to the menu if 
the menu is configurable.
